# CTR-dataset
This is the compressed package of the CTR dataset, which has been divided into training, validation, and testing sets.
The structure of the folder is as follows:

--train

----01

--------01_1

--------01_2

--------01_3

----02

--------02_2

--------02_3

--------02_4

----03

--------03_1

--------03_2

The folder structure of val and test is consistent with train.

Among them, 01 represents brooming, 02 represents exposed aggregate, and 03 represents PE membrane, the suffix represents roughness grades, where _1 represents very smooth, _2 represents smooth, _3 represents rough, and _4 represents very rough.

The roughness data obtained by the 3D laster scanning method is stored in the 3d_laser_scaning-results.xlsx file.
